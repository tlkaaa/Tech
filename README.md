### Reflection
TECH was the first ever website build by myself during early 2022 with the mind of using Nielsenâ€™s ten Usability Heuristics, my early exposure in web development. During this project, I have encountered a lot of difficulties on the some of the basic syntax and logic. Through countless hours of learning through errors and research, I have finally created my first ever functional website. I know this is just the beginning of my journey as there are much to learn for me to grow. I am always ready to accept challenges and willing to learn new things.
